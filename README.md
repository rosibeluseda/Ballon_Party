# Balloon Party
This mobile game, developed in Unity, uses the microphone to let players blow up a balloon. On the screen, players will see a balloon and a silhouette indicating the target area where the balloon should be kept blown up for a varying amount of time each round. The challenge is to maintain the balloon within the silhouette for the required duration to progress through the levels.
